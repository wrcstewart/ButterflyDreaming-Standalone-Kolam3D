# Refresh the vendored module from the ButterflyDreaming working tree.
#
# Vendoring is deliberate — a developer should be able to open the module, read
# it and break it without a server — but the cost is DRIFT, and this project has
# paid it before: two copies of an earlier module diverged and polish landed in
# only one of them. So the copy is refreshed by one deliberate command, and the
# commit it came from is written down.
#
# COPY-DOWN, NOT A MERGE. Local changes to visual_module.html are discarded.
